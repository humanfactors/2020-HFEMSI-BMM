        <h3>1. Summary<br>
        </h3>
        The crews of the first two Apollo missions - the checkout flight
        of the Command and Service Modules (CSM) in Earth orbit on
        Apollo 7 and the CSM flight to lunar orbit on Apollo 8 - did not
        get adequate sleep primarily because it was deemed necessary on
        these pioneering missions that at least one crewmember be awake
        at all times.&nbsp; Along with other factors, the need to fit
        two sleep periods into each day produced large disruptions to
        the crews' circadian work/sleep cycles.&nbsp; Although the crews
        - particularly on Apollo 8 - were able to fulfill mission goals,
        it was clear that careful attention would have to be paid to
        work-sleep schedules on subsequent missions to ensure adequate
        rest.<br>
        <br>
        During the next two flights - checkout of the LM in Earth orbit
        on Apollo 9 and the final landing-mission rehearsal in lunar
        orbit on Apollo 10 - all three crewmembers slept simultaneously
        and were able to get good rest.&nbsp; On Apollo 10, the crew had
        a 14-hour rest period prior to lunar orbit insertion and a
        shorter rest period prior to LM operations.&nbsp; Unlike the
        first two crews, they did not show any signs of post-flight
        fatigue.<br>
        <br>
        Generally, the subsequent crews arrived in lunar orbit well
        rested.&nbsp; Whenever possible, flight plans were organized to
        minimize shifts of the sleep cycle.&nbsp; The only notable
        exception was Apollo 14.&nbsp; That crew had to deal with the
        largest sleep-cycle shift in Apollo and got relatively poor
        sleep.<br>
        <br>
        The first three LM crews did not obtain adequate sleep on the
        lunar surface because they did not remove their suits for the
        single rest period scheduled for each crew.&nbsp; In part, the
        lunar stays were too short to allow the crews to doff their
        suits before the rest period and don them again
        afterwards.&nbsp; In addition, NASA and the crews weren't
        confident that the zippers would seal properly if the suits were
        taken off and put on again.<br>
        <br>
        On Apollo 11, Armstrong and Aldrin did not have hammocks and
        tried to make themselves comfortable on the floor (Aldrin) and
        the ascent engine cover (Armstrong) for a four-hour rest.&nbsp;
        Neither was able to sleep because of (1) the suits were
        uncomfortable, (2) the cabin was cold, (3) there was noise from
        a glycol pump in the Environmental Control System, and (4)
        sunlight was leaking into the cabin around the window shades and
        through the Alignment Optical Telescope.<br>
        <br>
        On Apollo 12, Conrad and Bean had hammocks but obtained only
        about 3 hours fitful sleep.&nbsp; Conrad experienced significant
        shoulder pain due to improper suit fit and had to wake up Bean
        to let out the laces on Conrad's lower legs.<br>
        <br>
        On Apollo 14, Shepard and Mitchell got very little sleep because
        of suit discomfort and because of a sensation that the LM was
        about to tip over.&nbsp; Inadequate sleep obtained on the trip
        out to the Moon may have been a contributing factor.<br>
        <br>
        The last three mission each included a lunar-surface stay of
        roughly 72 hours and three rest periods.&nbsp; From the
        experiences of the prior crews, it was clear that they would be
        unable to complete the ambitious schedule of lunar surface
        activities they had planned unless they got adequate rest.&nbsp;
        Doffing the suits for the rest periods was essential and,
        generally, all three crews slept well.<br>
        <br>
        Some of the astronauts took Seconal (Eli Lilly branded
        Secobarbital, a barbituate) sleeping tablets on occasion during
        their missions.<br>
        <h3>2. Lessons<br>
        </h3>
        Adequate sleep in the small volumes available in the Apollo
        Command Module and Lunar Module was most easily achieved if (1)
        there was minimum disruption to the pre-flight circadian rhythm
        of the crew members; (2) all crewmembers in the spacecraft slept
        at the same time; (3) crewmembers were able to doff their suits
        before sleeping; (4) work schedules were organized&nbsp; - and
        revised as needed - to provide an undisturbed (radio quiet) 6-8
        hour rest period during each 24-hour period; (5) in
        zero-gravity, loose restraints were provided to keep the crewmen
        from drifting; (6) on the lunar surface, a hammock or other form
        of bed was provide; (7) there was an adequate combination of
        cabin temperature and sleepwear for comfort; (8) the crew could
        dim instrument lights and either cover their eyes or exclude
        sunlight from the cabin; and (9) equipment such as pumps were
        adequately muffled.<br>
        <br>
        The last three LM crews -&nbsp; those that spent three days on
        the Moon and were able to doff their suits for the rest periods
        -&nbsp; reported that they slept very well.&nbsp; On Apollo 15,
        Jim Irwin said that his first sleep on the Moon was his best
        sleep of the mission, despite being awakened an hour early to
        investigate a water leak in the cabin.<br>

        <h4 style="margin-left: 40px;">3.1 Apollo 7</h4>
        <div style="margin-left: 40px;">Launch: 15:02:45 GMT, 11 October
          1968<br>
          Splashdown: Ground Elapsed Time 260 hr 09 min 03 sec<br>

          <br>
          Apollo 7 has been described as Apollo's 'shakedown cruise' in
          Earth orbit, the first flight of the Command and Service
          Modules (CSM) with a crew onboard.&nbsp; Because NASA had only
          13 1/2 months to complete the task of completing a successful
          landing mission "before this decade is out", the flight plan
          was full.&nbsp; If at all possible, NASA wanted to be able to
          next fly the CSM on a far more ambitious mission. Because this
          was the first crew to fly a CSM, at least one of them would be
          awake at all times; the need to fit two sleep periods into
          each 24 hours made the flight plan even tighter.&nbsp; And,
          finally, all three crewmembers developed head colds early in
          the flight, which didn't help their productivity and probably
          contributed to the bad relations that developed during the
          flight between Apollo 7 Commander Schirra and Houston. <br>
          <br>
          The crew removed their suits not long after reaching Earth
          orbit and these were stowed under one of the couches.&nbsp;
          Sleeping bags were secured under the other two couches with
          straps and the sleeping crewmembers slept in the bags,
          floating in zero-gravity.&nbsp; The crew did not have to cover
          the spacecraft windows during sleep but, rather, covered their
          heads with sleeping bag fabric and were not bothered by the
          sunlight.&nbsp; Biomedical data, including heart rate, were
          available from only one crewman at any one time.&nbsp; A
          switch on the instrument console could be set at one of three
          positions.&nbsp; The crew made regular reports on water
          consumption and any medication taken.&nbsp; Reports on the
          amount and quality of sleep were made occasionally.&nbsp; Crew
          status reports became more formalized, starting with Apollo 9
          and becoming part of the daily routine with Apollo 11.<br>
          <br>

            7 Mission Report</a>) Like prior (Mercury/Gemini) crews, all
          three crewmembers experienced a sensation of fullness of the
          head shortly after achieving orbit.&nbsp; After the flight,
          the Commander stated that he became aware of head cold
          symptoms within an hour of launch, but did not report his cold
          to Houston until about 15 hours.&nbsp; Twenty-four hours
          later, the other two crewmembers reported having head
          colds.&nbsp; "The crew reported poor sleep for about the first
          three day of the flight and experienced both restful and poor
          sleep after that period."&nbsp; Late in the mission, at 214 hr
          40 min.&nbsp; Apollo 7 Commander Schirra recommended that
          Apollo 8 Commander Frank Borman immediately begin a review of
          his mission's timeline from liftoff onward "for sleep (and)
          work cycles, and for food periods."<br>

          minutes.<br>

          Apollo 8 was a circumlunar mission flown out of the planned
          Apollo sequence because of intelligence information that the
          Soviet Union was preparing send a crew of its own on a
          circumlunar flight.&nbsp; The success of such a mission would
          diminish the geopolitical impact of the first lunar landing;
          and, confident that the Soviets were not in a position to make
          a landing in 1969, NASA wanted to make sure that an American
          crew was the first to fly around the moon.&nbsp; Although
          planning for what became Apollo 8 first focused on a flight
          that would go out to the Moon, circle around the farside and
          return to Earth without entering lunar orbit, the final plan
          included ten lunar orbits.&nbsp; The twenty hours spent in
          lunar orbit would be the most challenging of the mission and
          the flight plan was designed to get a well-rested crew into
          lunar orbit.&nbsp; Once the crew was circling the Moon, there
          would be much opportunity for sleep until they were on their
          way home.<br>
          <br>
          As with Apollo 7, the pioneering nature of the mission meant
          that at least one crew member would be awake at all times.<br>
          <br>
          <br>
          The following is an extract from the Apollo 8 Mission Report:
          "Work/rest cycles.- The very busy flight schedule precluded
          simultaneous sleep and resulted in large departures from
          normal circadian periodicity, thus causing fatigue. The wide
          dispersions of the work/rest cycles are given in figure
          8-2.&nbsp;&nbsp; A 'practical shift' of 3 hours before or 8
          hours after the start of the usual Cape Kennedy sleep period
          is shown for the Command Module Pilot and Lunar Module Pilot.
          The Commander experienced a 'practical shift' of 11 hours
          before to 2.5 hours later than his assumed Cape Kennedy sleep
          time."<br>

          changes to the flight plan were required because of crew
          fatigue, particularly during the last few (lunar) orbits

          "We would like to see, in looking over the flight plan -
          perhaps we ought to put the rest periods a little bit shorter
          and more frequent.&nbsp; It seems it might work out
          better.&nbsp; We got all out of kilter on it yesterday.&nbsp;
          We are sort of trying to get back in a normal cycle."&nbsp; As
          can be seen in the following comparison of the planned and
          actual sleep periods, by and large the crew did switch to a
          pattern of shorter, more frequent sleep periods.&nbsp; <br>

          and providing television broadcasts for a global television

          Apollo 9 was flown in earth orbit primarily to allow two
          members of the crew to fly the LM as an independant spacecraft
          and check out systems and procedures that would be used during
          the early stages of descent from lunar orbit and during the
          final stage of the return to orbit on landing missions.&nbsp;
          For the first time in Apollo, all three crewmen had the same
          rest periods.&nbsp; They reported getting 6-8 hours of sleep
          per period, except for the fourth.&nbsp; Prior to that rest
          period they had fallen behind in preparations for the LM
          flight.&nbsp; They shortened the rest period so that they
          would be able to start LM operations at the scheduled time,

            Mb</a> ): " Work/rest cycles.- This mission was the first in
          which all three crewmen slept simultaneously. A definite
          improvement over the previous two flights was observed in the
          estimated quantity and quality of sleep. The lack of
          postflight fatigue was correspondingly evident during the
          physical examination on recovery day. It should be further
          recognized, however, that crew work load during the last 5
          days of flight was significantly lighter than on previous
          missions. The flight plan activities for the first half of the
          mission resulted in excessively long work periods for the
          crew, and the time allocated for eating and sleeping was
          inadequate. Crew performance, nonetheless, was outstanding.
          Departures from the crew's normal circadian periodicity also
          contributed to some loss of sleep during this time. The crew
          experienced a shift in their sleep periods, which varied from

          Apollo 10 was a final test of procedures and equipment prior
          to the first landing mission.&nbsp; Once in lunar orbit, the
          two-man LM crew entered their spacecraft and flew the descent
          profile down to 50,000 feet (15,000 meters), jettisoned the LM
          Descent Stage, and then performed a rendevous and docking with
          the CSM.<br>

          rest period, the LM flight. <br>

          The landing planned for this mission had to be abandoned
          because of an explosion in an oxygen tank in the Service
          Module that made the crew totally dependant on the limited
          resouces of the LM prior to re-entry into Earth's atmosphere.

          of the mission.&nbsp; They all slept about 5-1/2 hours during
          the first sleep period. During&nbsp; the second period, the
          Commander, Command Module Pilot, and Lunar Module&nbsp; Pilot
          slept 5, 6, and 9 hours, respectively. The third sleep period
          was&nbsp; scheduled for 61 hours, but the orygen tank incident
          at 56 hours precluded sleep by any of the crew until
          approximately 80 hours. After the incident, the command module
          was used as sleeping quarters&nbsp; until the cabin
          temperature became too cold. The crew then attempted to&nbsp;
          sleep in the lunar module or the docking tunnel, but the
          temperature in&nbsp; these areas also dropped too low for
          prolonged, sound sleep. In addition,&nbsp; coolant pump noise
          from the lunar module and frequent communications with&nbsp;
          the ground further hindered sleep. The total sleep obtained by
          each crewman during the remainder of the mission&nbsp; after
          the incident&nbsp; (about 87 hours from the incident to
          splashdown) is estimated to have been 11, 12, and 19 hours for

          <br>
          From the Apollo 11 Mission Report, Pilots' Report (Section
          4.12.6): "The rest period was almost a complete loss. The
          helmet and gloves were worn to relieve any subconcious anxiety
          about a loss of cabin pressure and presented no problem. But
          noise, lighting, and a lower-than-desired temperature were
          annoying. It was uncomfortably cool in the suits, even with
          water-flow disconnected. Oxygen flow was finally cut off, and
          the helmets were removed, but the noise from the glycol pumps
          was then loud enough to interrupt sleep. The window shades did
          not completely block out light, and the cabin was illuminated
          by a combination of light through the shades, warning lights,
          and display lighting. The Commander was resting on the ascent
          engine cover and was bothered by the light entering through
          the telescope (Alignment Optical Telescope, AOT). The Lunar
          Module Pilot estimated he slept fitfully for perhaps 2 hours
          and the Commander did not sleep at all, even though body
          positioning was not a problem. Because of the reduced gravity,
          the positions on the floor and on the engine cover were both
          quite comfortable."<br>
          <br>
          There was never much spare room in the LM cabin and, after the
          EVA, two rock boxes added to the clutter.&nbsp; After taking
          photographs out the windows to further document their EVA,
          Armstrong and Aldrin had a meal and then jettisoned the PLSSs
          and other gear, primarily in the interest of reducing the LM
          weight for the return to orbit, but also to give them more
          elbow room.&nbsp; Lunar gravity is weak enough that there is
          no discomfort in standing for hours at a stretch but, for
          their rest period, Aldrin tried to make himself comfortable on
          the floor across the front of the cabin and Armstrong got up
          on the engine cover farther aft.&nbsp; Later crews had
          hammocks, which made sleeping much more comfortable; and the
          last three crews were able to remove their suits for the rest
          periods, which allowed them to sleep well.<br>

          LMP Buzz Aldrin took aspirin on occasion to help him sleep. No
          other sleeping tablets were taken.<br>

                  up the cockpit and got things pretty well in
                  shape.&nbsp; This took us a while, and we planned to
                  sleep with our helmets and gloves on for a couple of
                  reasons.&nbsp; One is that it's a lot quieter with
                  your helmets and gloves on, and then we wouldn't have
                  any mental concern about the ECS and so on having two

                  suit loop (filtered oxygen going directly from the ECS
                  to the suit and then back again) would be a lot
                  cleaner."<br>
                  <br>
                  Armstrong - "A couple of comments with respect to
                  going to sleep in the LM.&nbsp; One is that it's
                  noisy; and two is that it's illuminated.&nbsp; We had
                  the window shades up (that is, covering the windows)
                  and light came through those window shades like
                  crazy.&nbsp; They're like (photographic) negatives and
                  a lot of light will shine through."<br>
                  <br>
                  [There is no discussion of the window shades in the
                  Apollo 11 Mission Report.&nbsp; However, the fact that
                  none of the other crews reported problems with light
                  coming in suggests that the shade design was modified
                  to use a more opaque material.] <br>
                  <br>
                  Armstrong - "The next thing is that there are several
                  warning lights that are very bright and can't be
                  dimmed.&nbsp; The next thing is that there are all
                  those radioactive illuminated display switches in
                  there. Third, after I got into my sleep stage and all
                  settled down, I realized that there was something else
                  shining in my eye.&nbsp; It turned out to be that the
                  Earth was shining through the AOT (Alignment Optical
                  Telescope) right into my eye. It was just like a light
                  bulb.&nbsp; If I had thought of that ahead of time, we
                  could have put the Sun filter on or something that
                  would have cut that light out. The next problem we had
                  was temperature.&nbsp; We were very comfortable when
                  we completed our activities and were bedded down. Buzz
                  was on the floor and I was on the ascent engine
                  cover.&nbsp; We were reasonably comfortable in term of
                  temperature. We had the (LM cooling) water flowing and
                  the suit (oxygen) loop running.&nbsp; We had to have
                  the suit loop running because our helmets were closed.
                  After a while, I started to get awfully cold, so I
                  reached in front of the fan and turned the water
                  temperature to full up - Max increase.&nbsp; It still
                  got colder and colder. Finally, Buzz suggested that we
                  disconnect the water (flow into the suits), which I
                  did. I still got colder.&nbsp; Then, I guess, Buzz
                  changed the temperature of the air flow in the suit."<br>
                  <br>
                  [The cabin temperature through the rest period was in
                  the range of 61 to 62 degrees Fahrenheit or about 16
                  degrees Celsius.&nbsp; During the EVA prep at
                  108:38:36, Public Affairs reported to the press that
                  the cabin temperature at that time was 61 degrees
                  Fahrenheit, a comfortable temperature while they were
                  working in the suits, but not when they were trying to
                  sleep.&nbsp; For subsequent missions, ECS operating
                  procedures were modified to produce a comfortable
                  cabin temperature of about 71-72 degrees Fahrenheit.]<br>
                  <br>
                  Aldrin - "Yes.&nbsp; We fell victim to a time
                  constant.&nbsp; Once we noticed it going bad, there
                  wasn't anything we could do about it. In addition,
                  because we were trying to minimize our activities and
                  stay in some state of drowsiness, we didn't want to
                  get up and start stirring around, because it would be
                  that much harder to get back to that same state
                  again.&nbsp; So we tried to minimize our
                  activity.&nbsp; We underestimated how much light was
                  coming in through the windows.&nbsp; There must have
                  been a significant amount of light and heat coming in
                  and just being reflected off the surface. We had no
                  feel for what gas-flow setting we should have had,
                  because we'd been on the cooling all the time up to
                  that point while moving around I'm not sure that
                  there's much control over that anyway.&nbsp; We
                  finally disconnected the oxygen flow."<br>
                  <br>
                  Armstrong - "But that requires that you take your
                  helmet off, so that you can breathe when you turn the
                  suit disconnects (that is, shut off the flow from the
                  ECS into the suits). This means that it gets noisy
                  again, and all you hear is a glycol pump and stuff
                  like that. This was a never-ending battle to obtain
                  just a minimum level of sleeping conditions, and we
                  never did.&nbsp; Even if we would have, I'm not sure I
                  would have gone to sleep."<br>
                  <br>
                  Aldrin - "I don't know who was on Biomed at the time
                  (it was Neil), but I feel that I did get a couple of
                  hours maybe mentally fitful drowsing.&nbsp; I'll have
                  to say that I think I had the better sleeping
                  place.&nbsp; I found that it was relatively
                  comfortable on the floor, either on my back with feet
                  up against the side, or with my knees bent (and his
                  feet on the floor, the cabin width being insufficient
                  for him to stretch out).&nbsp; Also, I could roll over
                  on one side or the other.&nbsp; I had the two OPSs
                  stacked up at the front of the hatch, so there was
                  ample room on the floor for one.&nbsp; But there
                  wasn't room for two."<br>
                  <br>
                  Aldrin - "To cut down on the light level, we're just
                  going to have to do something with the window shades
                  to make them more effective.&nbsp; I think sleeping
                  with the helmet on will keep the cooling down and is
                  probably a good, reasonable way to go as long as
                  you're going to keep the suit on. Unless some change
                  is made, we'd never even think about taking the suits
                  off."<br>
                  <br>
                  Collins - "Apollo 12 is planning to take their suits
                  off.&nbsp; With the longer stay-time and a couple of
                  EVAs, they're planning to take their suits off."<br>
                  <br>
                  Aldrin - "I think they ought to think a little more
                  about it.&nbsp; I don't know what the temperature
                  would be in there. I got the impression that it was a
                  lot cooler outside the suit than it would have been
                  inside.&nbsp; I don't feel that having the suit on in
                  one-sixth g is that much of a bother.<br>
                  It's fairly comfortable.&nbsp; You have your own
                  little snug sleeping bag, unless you have some
                  pressure point somewhere.&nbsp; Your head in the
                  helmet (which has a pad at the back of the head)
                  assumes a very comfortable position. Even out of the
                  helmet, you don't have to worry about what you're
                  leaning against.&nbsp; Your head doesn't weigh that
                  much, and will very comfortably pick just about any
                  position.&nbsp; I just don't see the real need for
                  taking the helmets off."<br>
                  <br>
                  Armstrong - "I didn't mind sleeping on the engine
                  cover.&nbsp; I didn't find it that bad.&nbsp; I made a
                  hammock out of a waist tether - which I attached to
                  some structure handholds - to hold my feet up in the
                  air and in the middle of the cockpit. This kept my
                  feet up about level with or a little higher than my
                  torso."<br>
                  <br>
                  Aldrin - "Well, you were back out of the mainstream of
                  the light, except for the AOT.&nbsp; I think we could
                  fix that up and obtain a more horizontal position or
                  the capability to roll from one side to the other.
                  That's just something that has to be worked out.&nbsp;
                  It wasn't satisfactory.&nbsp; If we had known then
                  what we know now, we could have preconditioned the
                  cabin a little bit better (in terms of
                  temperature).&nbsp; We needed to start at a warmer
                  level by turning the water off, thereby storing a
                  small amount of heat."<br>
                  <br>
                  Armstrong - "That's just one of those areas that
                  didn't occur to us.&nbsp; It clearly needs some more
                  work."<br>

                  [Ultimately, the Apollo 12 crew decided not to take
                  their suits off between the two EVAs.&nbsp; However,
                  they took their helmets off, kept the flow of cooling
                  water off, connected the hose bringing oxygen from the
                  ECS to the suit O2 outflow connector (which put warm
                  oxygen from the ECS into the suit at the feet and
                  wrists) and the outflow hose to the inflow connector
                  (which returned air to the ECD from the
                  neckring),&nbsp; and strung up hammocks to sleep in.
                  They did not report any problems with noise, excess
                  light, or cold temperatures keeping them from
                  sleep.&nbsp; Neither of them slept more than three
                  hours, but the brief sleep was due to a poor fit of
                  Pete Conrad's suit that was causing him sufficient
                  discomfort that he and Al Bean had to get up early to
                  fix it. The Apollo 14 crew had the same sort of
                  arrangements as the 12 crew but found that they had
                  trouble getting their heads into comfortable
                  positions, perhaps because of the rigid neckrings. In
                  addition, their spacecraft had landed with a
                  significant tilt and, when they were in a drowzy
                  state, the tilt produced a sensation that the LM was
                  about to tip over.&nbsp; That sensation kept them both
                  awake. Starting with Apollo 15, the astronauts got out
                  of their suits after each EVA and it made a world of
                  difference. They were able to get comfortable in the
                  hammocks and, on the whole, they slept soundly.&nbsp;
                  Some of them felt more excitement about the situation
                  than the others did and had trouble falling asleep
                  but, all of them slept soundly for at least a few
                  hours each rest period, and woke up refreshed and
                  ready to go back to work. Neil and Buzz and the other
                  early crews demonstrated the obvious - that it was
                  possible to accomplish a great deal with limited
                  rest.&nbsp; And the later crews demonstrated that
                  simple additions to the equipment list - and
                  confidence in the suit that let them take it off and
                  put it back on three times - made it possible to get
                  adequate rest at a small cost in lunar surface stay
                  time.]<br>

          This was the first mission with two scheduled EVAs and the
          first use of hammocks during the rest period between the
          EVAs.&nbsp; In preparing for the rest period, the crew put the
          Commander's hammock up fore-and aft about halfway between the
          top of the ascent engine cover and the ceiling.<br>

            Mb</a> ):&nbsp; "Sleep periods during translunar coast began
          approximately 7 to 9 hours after the crew's normal bedtime of
          11 p.m. The crew reported that they had no particular trouble
          in adapting to the shifted sleep periods.&nbsp; However, the
          first flight day was extremely long, and the crew was
          thoroughly fatigued by the time the first sleep period began
          17 hours after lift-off. The crewmen slept well in the command
          module during the translunar and transearth coast phases, and
          the Lunar Module Pilot took at least two unscheduled naps
          during transearth coast. However, they reported their sleep
          periods were longer than necessary, since they would
          invariably awaken about 1 hour ahead of time and would usually
          remain in their sleep stations until time for radio contact.
          The lunar module crew slept only about 3 hours on the lunar
          surface prior to the second extravehicular activity period. In
          the next sleep period, following rendezvous and docking, all
          three crewmen in the command module slept only 3 or 4 hours,
          which was less than desirable.&nbsp; Biomedical monitoring
          during sleep periods was very limited. The crew complained
          that it was inconvenient to hook up to the biomedical harness
          while in the sleeping bags ; hence, very little data were
          received."<br>
          <br>
          The short sleep the LM crew had between their two EVAs was due
          to signifcant pain Apollo 12 Commander Pete Conrad had in his
          shoulders because the suit was too short.&nbsp; After about 3
          hours of fitful sleep, Conrad woke LMP Alan Bean so that Al
          could undo the laces on Pete's lower legs, let it out to
          relieve Conrad's pain, and re-lace them.&nbsp; A full
          discussion can be found in the Apollo 12 Lunar Surface Journal
          after <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a12/a12.posteva1.html#1223727" target="new">122:37:27</a>.<br>
          <br>
          The short sleep after rendezvous and docking was due to the
          need to control the large quantity of lunar dust the LM crew
          brought up on their suits and gear that was to be transferred
          to the Command Module for the trip back to Earth.&nbsp; They
          also had to prepare for and perform the Transearth injection
          burn.&nbsp; They made up for the two short sleeps with a
          12-hour marathon once they were on the way home.<br>

          This mission was similar to Apollo 12 in that the crew did two
          EVAs with a rest period between them.&nbsp; The Apollo 14 crew
          spent two hours (one Command Module orbit) more than the
          Apollo 12 crew on the Moon.<br>
          <br>
          From the Apollo 14 Mission Report ( <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a14/A14_MissionReport.pdf" target="new">9
            Mb</a> ): "The shift of the crew's normal terrestrial sleep
          cycle during the first four days of flight was the largest
          experienced so far in the Apollo series. The displacement
          ranged from 7 hours on the first mission day to 11-1/2 hours
          on the fourth. The crew reported some difficulty sleeping in
          the zero-g environment, particularly during the first two
          sleep periods. They attributed the problem principally to a
          lack of kinesthetic sensations and to muscle soreness in the
          legs and lower back. Throughout the mission, sleep was
          intermittent; i.e., never more than 2 to 3 hours of deep and
          continuous sleep. The lunar module crewmen received little, if
          any, sleep between their two extravehicular activity periods.
          The lack of an adequate place to rest the head, discomfort of
          the pressure suit, and the 7-degree starboard list of the
          lunar module caused by the lunar terrain were believed
          responsible for this insomnia. The crewmen looked out the
          window several times during the sleep period for reassurance
          that the lunar module was not starting to tip over. Following
          transearth injection, the crew slept better than they had
          previously. The lunar module crewmen required one additional
          sleep period to make up the sleep deficit that was incurred
          while on the lunar surface.&nbsp; The crewmen reported during
          postflight discussions that they were definitely operating on
          their physiological reserves because of inadequate sleep. This
          lack of sleep caused them some concern; however, all tasks
          were performed satisfactorily."<br>
          <br>
          The suit contributed to the lack of sleep in the Apollo 14 LM
          because the neckring made it difficult to position the head
          comfortably.&nbsp; The last three crews removed their suits
          for each rest period, which eliminated this problem.<br>
          <br>
          It is interesting to note that the Apollo 15 LM sat on the
          lunar surface with a larger tilt but that the crew did not
          report any feeling that the LM was about to tip over.&nbsp;
          The Apollo 14 tilt was 7 degrees to the right (LMP's side of
          the cabin down), the Apollo 15 LM was tilted back 6.9 degrees
          and left 8.6 degrees, with a total tilt of 11.0 degrees.&nbsp;
          <br>
          <br>
          In a 9-day mission, CDR Al Shepard only got about 41 hours of
          sleep, LMP Ed Mitchell got about 46, and CMP Stu Roosa got 44
          hours.&nbsp; In contrast, during the ten days of Apollo 12,
          each crew member got about 70 hours of sleep.&nbsp; Although
          none of the first three crews who landed on the Moon got much
          sleep while they were on the surface, the Apollo 14 crew was
          the only crew - since the adoption of all-crew rest periods
          for Apollo 9 - to get inadequate sleep in the Command Module.<br>

              <td style="vertical-align: top;">In 1991, Ed Mitchell
                talked about getting the hammocks up and getting into
                them.&nbsp; They slept without helmets, gloves, or EVA
                boots.&nbsp; Getting the hammocks properly routed thru
                the various suits hoses was tricky; they had rehearsed
                the procedure a few times.&nbsp; They did not use
                earplugs.&nbsp; A muffler had been installed in the ECS
                pump to reduce to an acceptable level the noise that had
                disturbed Neil's sleep.&nbsp; They woke several times
                because they both had a feeling that the LM was about to
                tip over.&nbsp; Ed describes the hammocks as being
                uncomfortable and realized that it was the suits that
                were causing the discomfort.&nbsp; There wasn't time in
                a 32-hour lunar stay to doff and don them between EVAs;
                and, perhaps more importantly, there was concern about
                jeopardizing suit integrity.&nbsp; Removing the suits
                for comfort during the 3-EVA misisons was imperative to
                avoid crew exhaustion, which Ed thinks was a bigger risk
                to the mission than the possibility that loss of suit
                integrity would force cancellation of one or more EVAs
                and an early return to orbit.&nbsp; Experience with the
                suits gained from Apollos 11, 12, and 14 made it
                possible to decide to remove the suits for the Apollo
                15, 16, and 17 rest periods.<br>

          their suits before each rest period so that they would have a
          better chance of getting adequate rest.&nbsp; They were the
          first crew to use earplugs during the sleep periods;&nbsp; to

          From the Apollo 15 Mission Report ( <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a15/ap15mr.pdf" target="new">15 Mb</a>
          ):&nbsp; "Very little shift of the crews normal terrestrial
          sleep cycle occurred during the translunar and transearth
          coast phases of this mission. As a result, all crewmen
          received an adequate amount of sleep during these periods.
          Displacement of the terrestrial sleep cycle during the three
          lunar surface sleep periods ranged from 2 hours for the first
          sleep period to 7 hours for the third sleep period. This shift
          in the sleep cycle, in addition to the difference between the
          command module and lunar module sleep facilities, no doubt
          contributed to the lunar module crewmen receiving less&nbsp;
          sleep on the lunar surface than was scheduled in the flight
          plan. However, the most significant factors causing loss of 
crew
          sleep were operational problems. These included hardware
          malfunctions as well as insufficient time in the flight plan
          to accomplish assigned tasks. During the first sleep period,
          the crewmen went to sleep one hour later than planned and had
          to arise one hour early to fix a cabin oxygen leak. The
          crewmen again were an hour late in getting to sleep for the
          second lunar surface sleep period. The final sleep period was
          changed so that the beginning of the period was 2 1/2 hours
          later than originally planned. The period, which had been
          planned to last 7 hours, was terminated after 6 1/2 hours to
          begin preparations for the final extravehicular activity. 
Lengthening the work days and reducing the planned sleep periods on the 
lunar surface coupled with a significant alteration of the lunar module 
crewmen's circadian rhythm produced a sufficient fatigue level
          to cause them to operate on their physiological reserves until

          ALSJ, the crew decided early in the planning processes that
          they were going to build the mission on a 24-hour Houston
          day.&nbsp; Despite the Mission comments quoted above, Dave and
          Jim believed that they'd gotten adequate sleep.&nbsp;
          Certainly, they got more quality sleep on the lunar surface
          than any prior crew.<br>
          <br>
          From the Pilot's Report in the Apollo 15 Mission Report: "The
          crew was able to sleep fairly well. Noise was minimized by
          configuring the environmental control system in accordance
          with the checklist and by using earplugs. The temperature was
          ideal for sleeping in the constant-wear garment and sleeping
          bag, or in the constant-wear garment and coveralls. A wider
          hammock would improve the conditions for sleeping. A slight
          light leak through the stitching on the window shades
          interfered with getting to sleep."<br>

          From the Apollo 16 Mission Report ( <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/A16_MissionReport.pdf" target="new">8
            Mb</a> ): "In contrast to the Commander's Apollo 10
          experience, he slept well during all the scheduled sleep
          periods. Typically, the Commander's sleep was uninterrupted
          for 4 to 5 hours after which he would awaken, get a drink of
          water, and return to sleep for the rest of the night. The
          Lunar Module Pilot slept well during all sleep periods except
          the first. However, the Command Module Pilot reported that he
          slept uninterrupted only two nights of the mission and,
          characteristically, would awaken about once every hour. He
          also stated that he never felt physically tired nor had a
          desire for sleep. On this mission, displacement of the
          terrestrial sleep cycle ranged from 30 minutes to 5 hours
          during translunar coast, and from 3 1/2 hours to 7 hours
          during the three lunar-surface sleep periods. This shift in
          the sleep cycle on the lunar surface contributed to some loss
          of sleep; however, this was the first mission in which the
          lunar module crewmen obtained an adequate amount of good sleep
          while on the lunar surface. This assessment of the amount of
          sleep is based on a correlation of heart rate during the
          mission sleep periods with preflight sleep
          electroencephalograms and heart rates. The estimates of sleep
          duration made by ground personnel were in general agreement
          with the crew's subjective evaluations."<br>
          <br>
          From the Pilot's Report : "The crew slept exceptionally well
          although the cabin temperature varied. The ear plugs were not
          used; it was felt that they were unnecessary. For the first
          sleep period on the lunar surface, the Commander donned only
          his sleeping bag, whereas the Lunar Module Pilot wore his
          liquid cooled garment while in his sleeping bag. For the
          second and third sleep periods, both crewmen wore their liquid
          cooled garments while in the sleeping bags. The intravehicular
          garments were never used. There was some light leakage into
          the cockpit ; however, it did not prevent the crew from
          sleeping. The Lunar Module Pilot aided his first sleep period
          by taking Seconal; however, he was awakened three times - the
          first two times by master alarms caused by the reaction
          control system 'A' problem, and the third time by an apparent
          loss of communications lock during a handover which produced
          noise in his earphones. The first sleep period lasted about 8
          hours. In general, the cabin configuration is acceptable to
          get a good night 's sleep."<br>

          lunar landing and one before each of the first two lunar
          surface rest periods.<br>

                the Comand Module resulted in a 6-hour delay in
                landing.&nbsp; John and Charlie had awakened at about
                91:30 and had planned planned to do an EVA before their
                first rest period.&nbsp; They would have started that
                first rest period at about 113 hours, after a 21 1/2
                hour day.&nbsp; If they had tried to do an EVA after the
                delayed landing, they would have had a 27 1/2 hours day
                and, in Houston, Flight Director Gerry Griffin was
                unwilling to test their endurance to that extent.<br>

                thought I was (going to feel).&nbsp; I really want to
                get out, but I think that discretion is the better part

                tempting, though.&nbsp; It really looks nice out
                there."&nbsp; By the early 1990s, Charlie had changed
                his mind.&nbsp; He said he was so pumped up with
                adrenalin and enthusiasm, that "I had a tough time
                getting to sleep."&nbsp; The Apollo 17 crew decided to
                do an EVA after landing, planning to wake up in lunar
                orbit at 105 hour 45 minutes and, after landing and
                doing an EVA, starting their first lunar surface rest
                period at about 128 hours, after a bit more than a
                22-hour day, similar to what the Apollo 16 crew had
                planned.&nbsp; Except for some timing differences,

                pegged out the EKG about 20 minutes ago."&nbsp;
                (Confirmed to CapCom by the Surgeon.) During the
                post-flight debrief, John mentioned that the suits piled
                on the engine cover "were up into the hammock about
                three inches"and the support under his back made it feel
                like he was "sleeping on a bed".&nbsp; Charlie took a
                Seconal tablet before each of the first two rest periods
                to help him overcome his excitement..&nbsp; John said he
                was 'warm' at the start of the rest period, took
                everything off and "slept in the sleeping bag with
                nothing on.&nbsp; I woke up in the middle of the night
                and my feet were freezing. So I turned around (putting
                his feet toward the back of the cabin) and put the ISA
                (Interim Stowage Assembly, a set of cloth bags) over my
                feet and went right back to sleep.&nbsp; Worked like a
                charm.&nbsp; But the next couple of nights, I slept in
                the LCG (Liquid Cooled Garment, but without water flow)
                because it was really cold at night."&nbsp; Charlie
                agreed that they needed to wear the LCGs and use the
                sleeping bags, because it was "chilly at night".&nbsp;
                He, too, didn't use the bag when he first went to sleep,
                but used it later after he cooled down.&nbsp; Because of
                the 6 hour landing delay, they needed to conserve
                battery power, so Houston had them power down more
                equipment than would have normally been the case.&nbsp;
                This may have contributed to the cool conditions.<br>

            Mb </a>) Biomedical Evaluation: "As on previous missions,
          displacement of the terrestrial sleep cycle contributed to
          some loss of sleep. In addition, changes to the flight plan
          occasionally impacted previously planned crew sleep
          periods.&nbsp; In general, however, an adequate amount of good
          sleep was obtained by all crewmembers. The estimates of sleep
          duration made by ground personnel were in general agreement
          with the crew's subjective evaluations.&nbsp; All three
          crewmen averaged approximately six hours of sleep per day
          throughout the mission. Only during the first sleep period was
          the amount of sleep obtained (approximately three hours)
          inadequate from a medical point of view. The crew reported
          that the Seconal effectively induced sound and undisturbed
          sleep for a period of four to five hours.&nbsp; Sleep
          restraints were used for every sleep period by all three
          crewmen. The Commander also emphasized the importance of
          programming an eight-hour sleep period each day."<br>
          <br>
          From the the Mission Report's Pilots' Report: "The planning to
          include a short sleep period in the first day allowed the crew
          to return to a normal work-rest cycle ... (On the lunar
          surface) the liquid cooling garments were doffed at the end of
          each extravehicular activity and the constant wear garment was
          donned for sleep. The crew believed that their sleep was much
          more comfortable in the constant wear garment partly because
          it was cleaner than the liquid cooling garment. Also, the
          constant wear garment removed the general level of pressure
          that a tight-fitting liquid cooling garment exerts on the
          body."<br>

                debriefing, Jack wants to continue; but CapCom Joe Allen
                indicates they should finish eating and get ready for
                sleep.&nbsp; Making allowances for some padding in the
                timeline, they are about an hour behind.&nbsp; Gene
                tells Joe "We're working as fast as we can.&nbsp; Best
                place in the world to make it up is tomorrow night.",
                meaning that he doesn't want to cut EVA-3 short and
                would rather have a short second rest period, a full
                EVA, and catch up on sleep during the final rest period
                before LM launch.&nbsp; More discussion about the need
                for rest.<br>
